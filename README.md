# autocomposer
Lots of auto-generated music sounds really bad. This software doesn't make it any better but I think it doesn't make it any worse either.

The claim to fame here is that the program is very short and easy to understand. It generates 20 random songs in one run, but you can modify it to generate 200 or 2000.

Use it at you own risk. Your ears will not thank you.
